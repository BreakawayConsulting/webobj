pyspa
======

This library provides an easy to development a single page application (SPA) for the web.

The goal is to make it very easy to get up an SPA up and running, and very easy to make changes and develop it.

It is (currently) a non-goal to provide a web-server designed for actual deployment.


## Running examples

The *flub* example is a very simple example of how to use the webobj library.

    $ PYTHONPATH=. ./examples/flub/flub.py
